# Try Django

This is an exercise for Free Code Camp's Django Beginner's Course. The course 
creator's code is [here](https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/Try-Django).

There is no gitignore file, so all code is on GitHub. This does not matter as none 
of the data is "real" - it's purely an exercise to practice Django.
